# Snow Today Webapp

Enable users to browse daily snow variables in various regions (South-West US, maybe
eventually High Mountain Asia).

Depends on [Snow Today Webapp Server](https://github.com/nsidc/snow-today-webapp-server)
to function.

**WARNING: This software is currently in early development. The data required for the
server component is not yet publicly exposed, so you should not expect this to work on
your machine.**
