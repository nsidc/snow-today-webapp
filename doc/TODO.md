## Versioning

* Version this app!
* CHANGELOG
* How to keep track of compatibility between the server (data schemas) and this app
  (query types)? Can we write a utility that analyzes jsonschema files with typescript
  type definitions for compatibility? Maybe we could use `typescript-json-schema` to
  convert the Typescript interfaces to JSON schemas and diff?
